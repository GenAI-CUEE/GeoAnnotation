Installing packages and set up environment: [Installation.md](Installation.md) 

## Quick start

We will go over the following topics: 
- [Tutorial 1 image enhancement](Tutorial_1_image_enhancement.ipynb) for how to read, write, and enhance a satellite image in GeoTiff format;
- [Tutorial 2 mask detection SamGao2](Tutorial_2_mask_detection_SamGao2.ipynb) for how to extract detection mask with prompts, extract the bounding boxes, enhance the masks, and save it back to GeoTiff format; 
- [Tutorial 3 interactive warping](Tutorial_3_interactive_warping.ipynb) for how to extract homography between image pairs providing the correspondence points and apply the homography to warp Google map and the detection mask from previous tutorial. Then, we will extract the masks from the warped Google map.
